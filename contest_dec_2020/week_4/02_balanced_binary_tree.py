Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: true

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4

    def __str__(self):
